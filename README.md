# ImageExtractor9000
This is a tiny python script I made to download full-res images from speedhunters.com

## How to Use 

1. Navigate to the folder with the script via the command line and run it using:

    >python imageextractor.py 
    
    or
    >python3 imageextractor.py

2. Paste the url of the article you desire after the prompt.

3. The images will be downloaded into a folder in the same location as the script

4. Enjoy!
